                        <p class="large-text fade-in">There is a <span class="highlight">human rights crisis</span> in prisons in the United States today.</p>

                        <p class="fade-in">Every day, millions of people are dehumanized, terrorized, tortured, and denied proper medical care by prison administrators and guards in blatant disregard for law, policy, civil rights, and basic human decency.</p>

                        <p class="fade-in">The scale of human devastation across our criminal legal system is almost beyond comprehension. At this moment, there are <strong>1.3 million people</strong> incarcerated in United States prisons, and an average of <strong>450,000 people</strong> are admitted and released every year. The result is that <strong>1 in 20 Americans</strong> are incarcerated at some point in their lifetime, and nearly <strong>1 in 2 Americans (45%)</strong> have an immediate family member who has spent at least one night in jail or prison.</p>

                        <p class="fade-in">The impact of incarceration is profoundly consequential, regardless of the crime committed or the sentence served. A vicious combination of disconnection from family, loss of autonomy, lack of purpose, unpredictability, overcrowding, stays in solitary confinement, and trauma from witnessing violence or abuse creates long-lasting effects on mental and spiritual well-being.</p>

                        <div class="callout fade-in">
                            <div class="callout-content">
                                <strong>Each year in prison shortens life expectancy by two years.</strong>
                                <p>Mass incarceration has had such a profound effect on public health that it has led to an identifiable and statistically significant decline in the life expectancy of the country as a whole.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p class="fade-in">Incarceration destroys people physically, mentally, and spiritually, and that damage perpetuates cycles of poverty, illness, and violence that reverberate through our families and communities. And yet, there is little moral outrage or legal consequence for this human devastation.</p>

                        <h3 class="subsection-title fade-in">Three Key Reasons for This Crisis</h3>

                        <div class="reason-cards">
                            <div class="reason-card fade-in">
                                <div class="reason-number">01</div>
                                <h4>Invisibility</h4>
                                <p>Prisons are black boxes, often hidden in remote, rural areas. The people with vested interests in maintaining and growing carceral institutions have complete control of the narrative about them. The information flowing in and out of prisons is almost entirely controlled by prison staff. All correspondence is monitored, and it is very difficult (if not impossible) to tour a prison. Very few records of prison condition violations exist. The result is that the reality of the suffering behind prison walls is greatly obscured. 
</p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>Impunity</h4>
                                <p> The policies and laws that do exist to protect prisoners' rights are loosely and erratically enforced. Prison administrators and staff have almost total impunity over the maintenance of their facilities, and state and federal departments of corrections, whose interests mostly align with prison staff, internally manage most oversight and accountability mechanisms. Especially since the passage of <a href="https://inquest.org/remedying-wrongs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Prison Litigation Reform Act in 1996</a>, the pathways for meaningful legal accountability for prisoners' rights violations have almost entirely closed.</p>

                                <h4>Dehumanization</h4>
                                <p>There is a widespread belief that justice, accountability, and safety is achieved through torturous conditions. The American public has normalized the dehumanization of criminalized people and chosen to believe that prisons help more than they harm, despite strong evidence to the contrary. When criminalization intersects with other marginalized identities, as it so often does, like being poor, Black, foreign-born, disabled, addicted, or queer, <a href="https://criminaljusticerealm.com/buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this mindset</a> deepens fissures in our social and political fabric that have profound consequences for us all.</p>

                        <p class="large-text fade-in accent-text">It does not have to be this way.</p>
                        <p class="fade-in">Our communities will never be truly healthy or safe if that "safety" is predicated on the dehumanization of millions of people. It is up to us to protect our people and to demand a system of justice that is decent, fair, and healthy for us all.</p>

                        <p class="fade-in">We have a simple vision: every human being, no matter what crime they may or may not have committed, deserves basic humanity, dignity, and respect, for the sake of their families, our communities, and our world. Through direct advocacy for incarcerated people using the administrative remedy process, we disrupt abuse in real time while building the public will and people power to take on the human rights crisis that is the United States prison system.</p>

                        <p class="fade-in">The Remedy Project was founded by jailhouse lawyer <strong>David Z. Simpson</strong> and student organizer <strong>Anna Sugrue</strong> in 2020. They identified a gap in the prison movement landscape: there was no broad-based support nor movement infrastructure to fight for prisoners' rights. Over the last five years, Anna and David have brought together hundreds of students and justice-system-impacted advocates to fill this crucial gap while maximizing capacity and minimizing overhead.</p>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title fade-in">What is the administrative remedy process?</h3>

                    <p class="fade-in visible">The administrative remedy process is the only official avenue available to incarcerated people to raise an issue and seek relief for their conditions. In Federal Prison, where The Remedy Project operates, the process begins with an informal complaint submitted to the unit. It ends with "exhaustion"– an appeal to the Bureau of Prisons' Central Office in Washington, DC, and the option to bring the issue to federal court.</p>

                    <p class="fade-in visible">It is intended to be navigated by the incarcerated person alone, and it is managed entirely by the staff and administrators who are frequently the subject of the complaints. The result is a largely unknown process that is chronically misunderstood, underused, and marred by prison administrations' willful mismanagement, manipulation, hindrance, and retaliation.</p>

                    <p class="fade-in visible">David Simpson, The Remedy Project's founder, studied the administrative remedy process for over ten years in federal prison and developed a strategy that took advantage of prison staff's fears to get people the care, dignity, and justice they demanded. He found that a properly filed administrative remedy could quickly move previously indifferent staff, shake up the prison hierarchy, trigger investigations, and build a record that later supports habeas petitions, civil suits, or congressional inquiries.</p>
                   
                    <h3 class="subsection-title fade-in"> </h3>

                    <h3 class="subsection-title fade-in">How do we use it?</h3>

                    <p class="fade-in">Today at The Remedy Project, David and other formerly incarcerated advocates (whom we call "mentors") draw from their lived experience to train students and general volunteers to do the same. Since 2020, our team has helped individuals in federal prison navigate every stage of the administrative remedy process: corresponding with incarcerated individuals and their families, drafting complaints, analyzing responses, identifying policy violations, appealing denials, and escalating cases to oversight bodies when the system refuses to act.</p>

                    <p class="fade-in">We have created a <span class="highlight">one-of-a-kind grassroots advocacy program</span>, where any volunteer can learn to fight and win relief for incarcerated people without a legal education, years in court, or thousands of dollars in fees.</p>

                    <h4>History of the Administrative Remedy Process</h4>
                    <p>Grievance processes have existed in prisons in the United States in various forms for most of the 20th century. The administrative remedy process as we know it was formalized as the legal prerequisite to filing a prisoners rights lawsuit in the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1996. Lawmakers took this action in response to an overwhelming number of prisoners rights lawsuits reaching court through the late 80s and early 90s as the national prison population exploded and conditions deteriorated. The PLRA was also a final blow to prisoners rights activists who fought for access to the courts and used lawsuits as a tool to expand their civil and human rights from the 1960s to the 90s. After the passage of the PLRA, the number of prisons rights filings plummeted, and still remain critically low.</p>

                        <p class="story-text">Christopher Trenchfield reached out to The Remedy Project in January of 2025 with a report that he had been assaulted by a guard at FMC Butner, a Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina. Through our correspondence with Mr. Trenchfield, we learned his problems went much deeper than one guard's brutality. He told us he was in FMC Butner on a medical hold for severe mental illness, and he was facing possible involuntary civil commitment by the Federal Prison system. However, he had never been diagnosed with any mental illness before his incarceration, and he had no symptoms except situational anxiety. We uncovered that he had been arrested during a verbal dispute with his neighbor, and had never officially been convicted of a crime. Prosecutors had dropped his original charges months prior. But the Bureau of Prisons did not want to let him go. In their effort to keep an innocent man behind bars, a BOP psychiatrist diagnosed Mr. Trenchfield with "criminal insanity" and attempted to have him civilly committed. Through a series of administrative remedies and advocacy letters, The Remedy Project uncovered this web of lies. As a result Christopher Trenchfield was released from prison six weeks later.</p>

Mr. Nwokedi reached out to us because he was supposed to be released from prison, but the Bureau of Prisons would not let him go. He had a detainer placed on him at the beginning of 2020, which restricted him only to the maximum security prison at which he resided. He had filed a motion in New Jersey to remove his detainer, which the state granted. Without the detainer, Mr. Nwokedi was qualified for home confinement or a halfway house. However, a staff member told Mr. Nwokedi that this would not happen until at least a month later. After Mr. Nwokedi wrote to The Remedy Project, we were able to get him released from prison early.</p>

She reached out to us in March of 2025 for assistance with a medical situation - for over a year, she had been receiving a half-treatment for her gender dysphoria, a condition she had been diagnosed with before her incarceration. She was receiving a medication suppressing testosterone without receiving any hormone replacement, which is dangerously inconsistent with the international standard of care for gender dysmorphia, and resulted in severe anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and strong urges to self harm. Shortly after The Remedy Project began assisting Ms. Gillette with her administrative remedies, she was prescribed replacement estrogen - despite a Federal executive order instructing Bureau of Prison officials to cease gender affirming care altogether. She credits the administrative remedy we wrote and frequent calls with Remedy Project advocates as the reason for her life-saving prescription.</p>

                        <p class="story-text">Jordan Walker was sent to Federal Prison in 2021 for a financial crime she committed to support an opioid addiction. She hoped her 65 month sentence would give her a chance to finally get clean, and The Bureau of Prisons promised her treatment for her diagnosed Opiate Use Disorder. Instead, she found that drugs were much easier to come by at FCI Waseca, a federal women's prison in Minnesota, than drug treatment. She spent years on the waitlist for a drug treatment program, MAT. She tried to manage her own sobriety, but she found it nearly impossible. In the fall of 2024, overwhelmed by stress, in and out of relapses, and hopeless for her future, Ms. Walker attempted suicide. After her suicide attempt, rather than receiving support, Ms. Walker got a disciplinary ticket for "self-mutilation" and faced even harsher conditions, limited privileges, and potentially even time in solitary confinement. Our Remedy Writer Cecilia Zuniga appealed this disciplinary action, and won Ms. Walker back her dignity.</p>

The system in the BOP is geared to shove mental health and suicide attempts under the rug. Thank you for helping me get through the red tape. The work you are doing really does make a difference."

                <p class="large-text fade-in">Our work is built and driven by high school, college, and graduate students across the country. Students bring unique assets to the movement: <span class="highlight">passion, expansive networks, institutional resources, and a reputation for pioneering social change.</span></p>

                <p class="fade-in">By mobilizing young people, we are bringing a rich, untapped, and highly motivated base into the movement against mass incarceration to build a high-capacity, easily scalable organizing infrastructure with relatively low overhead.</p>

                <p class="fade-in">We have no trouble recruiting students. In fact, we always have more students ready to get engaged than we have organizing capacity to support them. Today's young people are coming of age during a period of mass social and political upheaval, and many are developing both deep indignation at the injustices around them and cynicism about the possibility for meaningful change. The Remedy Project fills an unmet need by providing students with an opportunity to harness their fear and anger in the service of concrete action.</p>

                <p class="fade-in">We are empowering a new generation of leaders with deep empathy for and solidarity with marginalized people, insider expertise and strategic tools to challenge and transform institutions, and the confidence to fight for a more just and healthy future.</p>

                <p>"Not only has working at The Remedy Project made me optimistic for the future of mobilizing students, but it has also helped me feel at peace with my future. At the start of sophomore year, I remember feeling so lost – broadly interested in social justice, but lacking focus and often paralyzed by a creeping feeling of imposter syndrome at Barnard. I gained so much self-confidence while working with The Remedy Project. Now, I feel sure about graduate school, and I either want to pursue a law or social work degree, thus allowing me to channel my academic passions into a people-driven practice. I may not necessarily be a lawyer, but I came away from this summer knowing that I want to work with people on a daily basis, implementing social change in a first-hand and tangible way."</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <p class="fade-in">While we are proud of the measurable impact we have achieved, our work also continues to unfold in the face of significant challenges. These obstacles reflect the structural barriers, institutional resistance, and resource limitations inherent to confronting one of the most opaque and powerful systems in the country. Understanding these challenges is essential to fully grasping the scope of our work, the persistence required to sustain it, and the strategic investments needed to deepen and expand our impact moving forward.</p>

                    <div class="challenge-number">01</div>
                    <h4>Overwhelming Demand</h4>
                    <p>We get far more requests for support than we can handle. We have enrolled 1,139 members over the past 5 years—close to 1 new member a day. However, only 40% have had cases opened, and only 19% have had cases written. Our waitlist is already 180 people long, and it grows at the same rate.</p>

                <div class="challenge-card fade-in">
                    <div class="challenge-number">02</div>
                    <h4>Resource-Intensive Work</h4>
                    <p>Each administrative remedy requires coordination between the incarcerated person, mentor, and student, plus diligent record keeping, 3+ pages of writing, policy research, and fact-checking. A single case can involve months of correspondence and multiple rounds of administrative remedies.</p>

                <div class="challenge-card fade-in">
                    <div class="challenge-number">03</div>
                    <h4>Data Overload</h4>
                    <p>We collect more information than we can analyze or publicize. We focus our limited capacity on doing the actual advocacy work, and sometimes neglect work outside the scope of an immediate complaint. We've struggled especially with tracking remedy case outcomes.</p>

                <div class="challenge-card fade-in">
                    <div class="challenge-number">04</div>
                    <h4>Expertise Bottleneck</h4>
                    <p>We have struggled to maintain formerly-incarcerated volunteers, because most people coming out of prison cannot afford or are unwilling to work for free. When David is the only person available to review, it significantly slows down the intake and output of remedy cases.</p>

                    <h4>BOP Resistance</h4>
                    <p>The Bureau of Prisons fights us back. Our "BOP Watchlist" is now more than 15 prisons long—facilities that have removed our email address, blocked our phone number, or illegally returned our mail. Staff also deny access to remedy forms, restrict stamps, and retaliate against filers.</p>

                    <h4>Worsening Conditions</h4>
                    <p>Over the last year, we have witnessed increased disregard amongst prison staff for law and policy, and more impunity for guards. With the rise in immigration arrests and detention, there is a new frontier of human rights abuses. Funding for justice-related causes is dwindling.</p>

                    <strong>The throughline across all six challenges: staff capacity.</strong>
                    <p>The Remedy Project's greatest challenges are not due to lack of vision, talent, willpower, or strategic leadership—it's lack of funding. With the number of ideas, students, formerly incarcerated mentors, and organizational partners hanging in the wings, we know our impact could triple tomorrow if we had the funded positions to coordinate it. Full capacity is not a dream. It is already here, waiting to be activated.</p>

                    <p>Solidify a robust daily direct advocacy operation, fully staffed and continually onboarding young people into the movement against mass incarceration, stopping the destruction of incarcerated people in real time, and collecting and disseminating data about conditions in the federal prison system.</p>

                    <p>With this rock-solid foundation, we will be poised to craft larger-scale strategic campaigns to win systemic changes in the prison system.
